public import UIKit

/// A wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate that view into your
/// OpenSwiftUI view hierarchy.
///
/// Use a ``UIViewRepresentable`` instance to create and manage a
/// [UIView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIView) object in your OpenSwiftUI
/// interface. Adopt this protocol in one of your app's custom instances, and
/// use its methods to create, update, and tear down your view. The creation and
/// update processes parallel the behavior of OpenSwiftUI views, and you use them to
/// configure your view with your app's current state information. Use the
/// teardown process to remove your view cleanly from your OpenSwiftUI. For example,
/// you might use the teardown process to notify other objects that the view is
/// disappearing.
///
/// To add your view into your SwiftUI interface, create your
/// ``UIViewRepresentable`` instance and add it to your SwiftUI interface. The
/// system calls the methods of your representable instance at appropriate times
/// to create and update the view. The following example shows the inclusion of
/// a custom `MyRepresentedCustomView` structure in the view hierarchy.
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///        var body: some View {
///           VStack {
///              Text("Global Sales")
///              MyRepresentedCustomView()
///           }
///        }
///     }
///
/// The system doesn't automatically communicate changes occurring within your
/// view to other parts of your SwiftUI interface. When you want your view to
/// coordinate with other SwiftUI views, you must provide a
/// ``NSViewControllerRepresentable/Coordinator`` instance to facilitate those
/// interactions. For example, you use a coordinator to forward target-action
/// and delegate messages from your view to any SwiftUI views.
