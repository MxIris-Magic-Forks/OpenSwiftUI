# Layout fundamentals

Arrange views inside built-in layout containers like stacks and grids.

## Overview

Use layout containers to arrange the elements of your user interface. Stacks and
grids update and adjust the positions of the subviews they contain in response
to changes in content or interface dimensions. You can nest layout containers
inside other layout containers to any depth to achieve complex layout effects.

To finetune the position, alignment, and other elements of a layout that you
build with layout container views, see <doc:Layout-Adjustments>. To define
custom layout containers, see <doc:Custom-Layout>. For design guidance, see
[Layout](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/layout) in the Human Interface Guidelines.
